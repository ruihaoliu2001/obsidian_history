## What I could do for grad study

ALWAYS REMEMBER:
- Physics
- Applications
- 231210: In physics, 最基本的问题 vs. 琐碎的问题 (C.N. Yang)

Top things to learn:
- Topology (Berry phase, quantum metric, **quantum geometry**, *Majorana zero modes*)
- Superconductivity
- IQHE, FQHE, AHE, QAHE, QSHE, FQAHE...
- exciton
- charge/pair density wave
- ferroelectricity

**Ideas:**
- **New interesting physics (has been studied in other systems) in new material. See the differences and new possible interpretations**
- **New material system**
- **New physics**

- Most important results show most directly (FQAHE paper, ferroelectricity paper...). If it looks rather complicated, that would not be very important (only details?)

**Learn basic knowledge. At the same time, keep track of what's going on lately in the community.**

*Topology* seems to be the main stream. **What is NEXT!** (2023/07/20)
**quantum geometry** (09/06/2023)

1. thermoelectricity for TBG (AHE demonstrated, ANE should be) or twisted TMD: quantized? other expected phenomena?
2. ferroelectricity 
3. spintronics in 2D (e.g. ferromagnetism in TBG, SOT, skyrmions, CrI3)
4. FQAHE
5. quasicrystals

Degrees of freedom:
- mostly cited 4: lattice, orbital, charge, spin
- valley
- twist angle
- stacking number
- gate voltage
- E, B, T

Note:
- interlayer exciton
- unconventional superconductivity, unconventional ferroelectricity, magnetism in TBG

Definitions to learn
- moiré superlattice potential
- capacitance measurement
- particle-hole symmetry
- if we consider a probe measurement that perturbs a system, **correlation functions** are typical measurables (from Mingda Li's Lab)

## Ideas updated 101823
1. Try TaSe2 contact for tWSe2
2. Try Pt contact for MoTe2, conduction band physics
3. SC diode: top obstacle is the current existing out-of-plane diode (could be many trivial explanations). Ideally, we must demonstrate in-plane diode. However, if we can achieve ferroelectricity switching, this can be strong evidence that the SC diode is intrinsic, i.e., Rashba SC diode.
4. tABC graphene + TMD (for SOC), to achieve anomalous Hall.

- spin selectivity (see Binghai Yan's lecture on Kouxiang)
## Ideas updated 101823
- Magnus Hall, electron fluid (Can we make it a deeper story, e.g., topology?) fluid- normal state transition?
- fractional QSHE

## 20230414
### Talking with Pablo (1st time)
1. new types of ferroelectricity
2. **spin-chirality, spin selective effect
3. (quantized) anomalous Hall in tGraphene
4. origins of many discovered phenomena
5. twisted helical structures (A. Uri, quasicrystal)
6. **FQAHE**
7. **OFFICE**

Q: different magnetic hystersis?

## 20230723

## 20230727
A quasiperiodic crystal, or **quasicrystal**, is **a structure that is ordered but not periodic**.  A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks translational symmetry.

Kai Liu (my uncle):
1. Imagination creation (both your father and I lack)
2. Publication: more is no wrong
3. Always remember what the most important question in your field is

## 20230906
Talk with Kenji:
- Try tMoTe2 and see what happens next
- You may perform a side project

## 20230907
### Meeting with Pablo (2nd time)
What to do?
**Pablo is thinking about what I could do and who I should work with!**
1. FQAH: but we need to think a lot further
2. CISS effect: will become a hot topic
3. Aviram and Liqiao: they do new things and went well. Other people will follow
4. Nernst things: Clement will leave. It is good for a new student? Hire a new postdoc
5. Other things: ferroelectricity, multiferrotics, coupling to supercon...
6. AI for selecting samples


## 20230908
### Chern number
Integral of Berry curvature over a whole band is its Chern number (zero or non-zero) - Chern band

### Journal Club - symmetry and QAHE
See iPad for details

## 20230911
### (eletro)chemical potential, Fermi energy, electrostatic potential
where are the doped electrons in the sample?

Talking with Liqiao&Aviram:
If you aim at Nano Lett., you will get a nature. If you aim at a Nature, you will get a Nano Lett.
One thing great about CMX is that it keeps giving you **surprise**!
## 20230922
pre-talking with Pablo
- everyone wants to make their PhD more exceptional
- new physics (majorana fermion, FQSHE), new materials (helical tri, rhombohedral-5 layer), new techniques (quantum twisting microscope)
- At first, TMD/QTM is preferred (TMD systems, kind of less explored. Conduction band physics). Sometimes, new physics is more interesting, no matter material system
- Chance of going to Barcelona
- To be world's best fabricator

Talk:
1. TMD: FQAHE, **couple to graphene**
2. QTM (Barcelona)

This is because I is always 1D. What if we have 2D I, can we only break one of two spatial symmetries to still have diode?
